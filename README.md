# risals: a web photo album generator
"risals" is a web photo album generator.
This software makes an HTML file which provides a list of the thumbnails of given JPEG photos.
Photo albums generated by using this software are composed of only static files, i.e. you are not required to prepare running server-side programs such PHP, ASP, and CGI.
You can see the sample photo albums generated with this software in https://arnip.org/photos.
